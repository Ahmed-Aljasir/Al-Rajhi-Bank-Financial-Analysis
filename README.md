# Financial Performance & Interest Rate Impact Analysis (2021–2025)

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Al Rajhi Bank’s financial performance over a five-year period (2021–2025), focusing on the intersection of profitability trends, balance sheet expansion, and macroeconomic shifts. The primary objective is to evaluate how changes in the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) repo rate influenced critical return metrics, specifically Return on Equity (ROE), during a time of significant earnings and asset growth for the bank. To communicate these insights effectively to stakeholders, an interactive and visually structured dashboard was developed using Tableau.

## Data Sources
The analysis relies on two primary data streams to ensure a holistic view of the bank's performance:
* **Bank Financials:** Key metrics including Net Profit, Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Total Assets, and Loans (Financing) were sourced from publicly available Al Rajhi Bank Annual Reports from 2021 to 2025.
* **Macroeconomic Data:** Annual repo rate figures were obtained from the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) to serve as a benchmark for interest rate conditions.

## Methodology
The project followed a rigorous analytical workflow to transform raw financial data into interactive insights:
* **Data Structuring:** The dataset was cleaned to ensure consistency across reporting periods, with the "Year" variable converted to a discrete time dimension for chronological accuracy.
* **Visualization Techniques:** Dual-axis charts were used to compare related metrics like ROA and ROE, while a scatter plot with a linear trend line was developed to isolate the correlation between SAMA repo rate movements and bank ROE.
* **Analytical Tools:** Year-over-Year (YoY) growth calculations were implemented to evaluate performance acceleration.
* **Interactive Design:** The final Tableau dashboard incorporates interactive filtering by year, allowing for dynamic data exploration.

## Key Insights
The analysis revealed a complex relationship between internal growth and external economic pressures:
* **Earnings Momentum:** Between 2021 and 2025, Al Rajhi Bank's net profit increased by approximately **46%**, signaling strong organic earnings growth.
* **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Despite rising profits, ROE demonstrated sensitivity to rising repo rates, showing a decline during periods of tighter monetary policy. This suggests that higher interest rates exerted pressure on shareholder returns even as the bank expanded.
* **Asset Acceleration:** Total assets expanded significantly following 2023, reflecting an accelerated growth phase in the bank's balance sheet.
* **Conclusion:** Ultimately, the findings highlight the critical interaction between a bank’s internal financial health and external monetary conditions.

## Assumptions & Limitations
* The SAMA repo rate is used as a proxy for the broader macroeconomic interest rate environment.
* The analysis utilizes annual data points and does not reflect quarterly variations or intra-year volatility.
* Figures have not been adjusted for inflation, and the study is based exclusively on publicly disclosed financial information.
